Spread-3.17.4.4
=====================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Spread-3.17.4.4 is a Perl module that conveniently wraps the Spread C
libraries provided with the Spread 3.17.4 distribution.  Spread is available at
http://www.spread.org/.  Spread is a local/wide area group communication
toolkit that runs on most modern operating systems.  It allows convenient
mechanisms for reliable multicasting information between applications as well
as providing many more complicate assurances.

CHANGES
-------

Version 3.17.4.4 fixes documentation about $sperrno and a possible short
copy of group name in multigroup multicast. Add processing of SPLIB_LIB
and SPLIB_INCLUDE environment variables to ease makefile generation.  Fixed
a few compiler warnings.

Version 3.17.4.3 fixes an unsafe pass of the spread version string as a
printf format string.  Thanks Jerome Quelin.

Version 3.17.4.2 fix typo in receive that prevented receiving messages
spent to more than 64 groups.  Also adds REJECT_AUTH error code.
Thanks Martin.

Version 3.17.4.1 add REJECT_MESS, remove _ from version.

Version 3.17.3_108 fix version to make MakeMaker happier.

Version 3.17.3-1.07 fix man pages and exports.

Version 3.17.3-1.06 differentiate between select timeout and other failures.
Thanks to Matt Sergeant.

Version 3.17.1-1.05 fixes a service_type error (uninitialized variable)

Version 3.15.2-1.04 adds a MANFIEST, dist to Makefile.PL, and several spelling
corrections.  The only used code change was the spelling correction of CAUSAL.

Version 3.15.2-1.03 updgrades the xs code to use the 3.15.2 Spread client
libraries.

Version 3.14-1.03 fixes a long standing mortilzation bug that caused an abusive
memory leak on systesm with many message.  The leak was in SP_receive. It also
adds this "changes" section.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Spread-3.17.4.1 requires the Spread group communication toolkit daemon and
client C libraries (with headers) to be installed (or compiled) on the system.

It will often not work correctly if there is an older libsp installed on the
system.

It also requires Perl 5.

INSTALLATION
------------

1.  Edit the Makefile.PL and change the -L and -I paths to reflect your
	installation of Spread if necessary.
2.  perl Makefile.PL
3.  make install
